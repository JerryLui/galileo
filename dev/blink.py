import mraa     # For accessing the GPIO
import time     # For sleeping between blinks
"""
This script demonstrates the usage of mraa library for controlling a 
GPIO as output
setup:
The LED is connected port D5
Demo:
start the application in the command line by using following command:
python blink.py
You should see LED blink 
You can exit this demo by hitting ctrl+c
